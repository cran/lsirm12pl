Description: Analysis of dichotomous, ordinal, and continuous response data using latent space item response models (LSIRMs). Provides 1PL and 2PL LSIRMs for binary response data as described in Jeon et al. (2021) <doi:10.1007/s11336-021-09762-5>, extensions for continuous response data, and graded response models (GRM) for Likert-scale ordinal data as described in De Carolis et al. (2025) <doi:10.1080/00273171.2025.2605678>. Supports Bayesian model selection with spike-and-slab priors, adaptive MCMC algorithms, and methods for handling missing data under missing at random (MAR) and missing completely at random (MCAR) assumptions. Provides various diagnostic plots to inspect the latent space and summaries of estimated parameters.
